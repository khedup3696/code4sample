===========

1) To migrate the old html version to our own custom CMS, so if we do manually it will take lots of time(more then 6000 articles), So the following code does the migration of html recursively into the directories and  by using a ///regex expression it will identifies the Title from the body and saves in our mysql databases.

the file is 1.php


2) my second code is for my project the tibetan dictionary artificial intelligence

 http://tsikzoe.net

I have created a strong script to translate tibetan vocabulary to english, if it’s not tibetan it would be easy but tibetan writing has no gaps between words and it’s complicated due to prediction of which all segment forms the word that user has typed. 

for instance  in tibetan aaabbbccc could mean a word at the same time aaabbb could mean something else and aaa and bbb, ccc could mean something else individually, and all words are joined until sentence finishes e.g. aaabbbccczzzddwwddkkgg  dddllkssfjjeoooog  thats why it’s hard to predict. if it’s english it would be simple as all words are separated by gaps.

the file is 2.php here there is a form where the inputs are accepted and process with strong logic codes.
I have full confidence to serve your reputed Company, and at the same time I will upgrade my knowledge at your place of knowledge. I won’t mind working first at low post.

3)blackjack.php

program which accepts two inputs, representing two playing cards out of a standard 52 card deck. Add these two cards together to produce a blackjack score, and print the score on the screen for the output.
Cards will be identified by the input, the first part representing the face value from 2-10, plus A, K, Q, J. The second part represents the suit S, C, D, H.
The blackjack score is the face value of the two cards added together, with cards 2-10 being the numeric face value, and A is worth 11, and K, Q, J are each worth 10.
